YES, reapplying thermal paste on ZOTAC graphic card will not void the warranty but make sure be extra cautious when doing it.\"  \n23:57**L:** I've been doing this for over 10 years  \n23:57**Paulo T:** we were surprised ourselves for this change in policy  \n23:57**Paulo T:** Same here  \n23:57**L:** you can't change the policy after I bought it  \n23:57**Paulo T:** all im saying was there was a change in policy  \n23:58**Paulo T:** you can no longer remove the heatsink  \n23:58**Paulo T:** i dont call the shots here. if you have concerns you can email rma.us@zotac.com  \n23:59**L:** i'm not removing the heatsink or fan  \n23:59**L:** we are getting off topic as this applies to only the thermal pads  \n00:00**Paulo T:** you mentioned thermal pads  \n00:00**L:** yes, i did not receive a manual indicating where the thermal pads should go and their corresponding thickness  \n00:01**Paulo T:** you cannot remove the back plate without removing the heatsink since the screws are from the inside to remove the back plate  \n00:01**L:** so this is what id like to know for the zotac 3090/3080  \n00:01**Paulo T:** there was no manual for that  \n00:01**L:** fair that there was no manual, i can't find any zotac materials online either  \n00:02**Paulo T:** there wasnt any related to it you can ask users probably  \n00:02**Paulo T:** just please bare in mind that will require you to remove the heatsink at it will void warranty. You can rma it to avoid voiding warranty  \n00:03**Paulo T:** thats what i suggest  \n00:03**L:** Can you give me the announcement to this change?  \n00:03**L:** There were no void-warranty stickers on the gpu  \n00:04**Paulo T:** I dont have access to it. this was communicated by my supervisor verbally.  \n00:05**Paulo T:** If you have questions about iit feel free to send an email to rma.us@zotac.com  \n00:07**L:** Okay so Zotac secretly changed their warranty guidelines without letting the public, customers know, when in recent history the company has promoted users to replace their thermal pads.  \n00:07**L:** I'll talk with rma then.  \n00:07**Paulo T:** yes please.  \n00:07**Paulo T:** same question for me  \n00:08**Paulo T:** anything else?  \n00:08**L:** You wont tell me the pad thickness right?  \n00:09**Paulo T:** thats 1.5 - 2mm  \n00:09**L:** do you have pictures/diagram?  \n00:10**Paulo T:** none  \n00:10**L:** alright thanks.  \n00:10**Paulo T:** there wasnt any provided for that  \n00:10**Paulo T:** thanks for contacting support.  \n\n\nI already made changes last week so they better still honor a replacement if there is anything else wrong with the card. He said this was changed yesterday so I wonder when they plan on actually plan on telling everyone themselves.  \n\n\nSeems like a great business plan though, give customers terrible pads, they do it themselves, Zotac won't tell anyone of the change, so they don't have to replace your semi-bricked GPU that should be breaking down shortly after the warranty as intended from extended use @ 104C+.",

    "content": "This might be silly, but it's happened to me twice now, and I just want to put it out there.\n\nI'm a reasonably attractive man who's had pretty good success in dating. I also happen to have fairly narrow shoulders compared to a lot of men. I've had two women in the last year—both of whom when I was seriously dating them, and both of whom wanted something long-term with me—tell me that they usually are attracted to men with really broad shoulders. I think in their minds, they're actually thinking of this as a compliment; something like, \"He's so great I don't even care about that\". But the way it comes across to me is just that my shoulders aren't as broad as what they usually like; and there's just nothing I can do about that. Women, would you be flattered if a man told you something like \"Oh, I'm usually really attracted to women with really full lips/large breasts/a certain waist-to-hip ratio\" or some other feature that you clearly didn't have?\n\n**TL;DR:** *You may normally be attracted to a particular feature, but it's not a compliment to tell someone you care about that you're normally attracted to a feature they don't have. Just tell them something about themselves that actually is attractive to you instead.*\n\n​\n\nEdit: I've had a few people comment that it just sounds like I'm insecure, and that's really not the point of my post at all. I'm pretty confident in myself one way or another. My main point was just that it's not really a good compliment to tell someone that they're not the kind of person you're usually attracted to.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the Gold and other awards!\n\nEdit 3: Thanks for the Platinum and all the Hugz!",

    "content": "TLDR; I befriend a coworker who put on a “caring guy” front while I was going through a vulnerable time and he eventually gets creepy and touchy and I find out what he’s done in the past. I cut him off but he insists on watching me from afar, and leaving me food and holiday gifts. And marking a work cart for me repeatedly with my full initials even though I’ve repeatedly erased them. All despite me reporting, ignoring and telling him to stop. Waiting to see what HR will do and hoping he doesn’t do more.\n\n\nI work overnight at a store, I’m a stocker. (25F) when I first started a guy around my age got hired a couple months after me. He started hanging around another coworker and I on break and we eventually became friends, even hanging out alone on breaks sometimes. He seemed pretty normal at first, agreeable and a good conversationalist. I was in a bad place mentally at the time and having someone “validate” me felt nice. At first.\n\nBut then he started getting... touchy. I would eventually be telling him more personal stuff and he would start to rub my back. I didn’t want to be rude at first so I didn’t say anything, but then he did it more often. I told him to stop and he seemed to be sorry, until doing it again eventually. I was alone with him all these incidents and the look on his face when he did, eventually, showed predatory vibes and not like the friend I thought I had.\n\nAround the time he started doing this he also confessed to me something he did in the past to a friend of his. You can probably guess what it’s along the lines of. He acted quite remorseful and said him and the friend are civil now, and that it was a long time ago. I think he also cried a bit. I’m generally a compassionate person who believes in second chances so while this is when more red flags started going off, I still hung out with him a bit, although more distantly. \n\nIt didn’t help that his general demeanor was, is one of a pitiful person. Nice act.\n\n\nHe hung out with my boyfriend and I a couple times. He lives near us so we were kind of excited to have someone to hang out with at first, but he just kept getting weirder and weirder the few times we hung out. He always seemed to be trying to subtly one-up my boyfriend, in a sarcastic manner. There was also a strange time when he did a deep belly laugh at an explicit sexual song playing on his car radio that my boyfriend and I just felt kind of uncomfortable about. \n\nHe’d make a point to not drink that much around us when we were drinking, despite bragging about how much he could down. He rubbed my back, yet again at one point while I was drunk when my boyfriend left the room, trying to pass off as “comforting”. He generally tried to be flirtatious whenever my boyfriend left the room.\n\nEventually enough was enough and I cut him off, although I still have to work with him. This was last summer. WE WEREN’T EVEN FRIENDS FOR THAT LONG. Since then he has:\n\nCome in early every night to put out my work stuff for me.\n\nLeaves me food and water and gifts, stuff that I’ve mentioned in conversations before. \n\nParks near me and waits for me to leave the parking lot so we can drive together I guess? One time he waited a half hour as I was chatting with another coworker.\n\nWaits in front of his house for me to pass by him to get home (I have to turn on his road to get to my road)\n\nStill says weird phrases my boyfriend and I used. \n\nTexts despite being ignored.\n\nHe’s written my full initials (which he remembers somehow) on a work cart in marker, and leaves the same one out for me every day. I always try to erase them (even wrote “stop” on it once) but the next day I’ll see he wrote them again. \n\nOh and whenever he walks by me he looks sad or pissy. Managers have talked to him and a report is going through HR right now but I just hope he doesn’t escalate. Despite being talked to he still leaves the cart and stuff out for me, with some water, and rewrites my initials. He’s so helpful and nice. /s",

    "content": "My mom is obsessed with my sister - my sister has never worked, doesn’t have a car, and her life is fully funded by my parents despite the fact that she is married and 27 years old. I (30F) own two small businesses with my husband and we work hard, long hours, especially through COVID. My husband and I had a miscarriage last year and were overjoyed to find out we were pregnant again this fall. My parents were so excited and were way more loving and attentive than they’ve ever been. That is, until my sister announced she was also pregnant. With twins. \n\nI have been supportive of my sister but was secretly devastated we’d be pregnant at the same time bc I knew my parents would not care about my pregnancy and my child would constantly be compared to my sisters kids for his entire life. They’re due about 35 days apart but my sister is having an elective c-section and has moved the date back farther each month so that we’re now due six days apart. \n\nMy friends and husband thought I was overreacting, until it was time for my baby shower. We live out of state, but my mom promised a virtual shower and we picked a date of April 11. I work a lot bc our staff is still furloughed due to covid, so I figured it was handled. I followed up a few times and was told they were figuring it out, and then was like omg it’s almost April 11! I called my mom that Friday to find out if it was happening, but she didn’t answer.\n\nApril 11 came and nothing. And then, my mom texted me a beautiful elaborate invitation to my sisters baby shower in a few weeks.\n\nThat’s it. She never called me back or anything.\nI realized that she completely forgot about it altogether. My husband no longer thinks I’ve overreacted, and we are now assuming neither of my parents will be coming to help with baby or have much interest at all. I’ve worked really hard in therapy to forgive and learn to deal with my family bc I want my son to have grandparents and cousins, but I don’t know if I want either of us to be in a family system where we don’t matter. I know how that feels already.\n\nAm I overreacting or being hormonal? I didn’t help plan the shower and wasn’t adamant about it, but I checked my texts and both me and my husband have messages from them saying they were doing it. \nBetween my family issues/history and being pregnant, I just don’t trust my own judgement.",
